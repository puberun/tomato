# tomato - A Restaurent Review System

This is a Web application that simplifies the task of finding a restaurant of choice based on the user's likes. This web app has sign up for new users and login for existing users.
When a user logs-in, the home page has restaurant search option by cuisines, restaurant type and restaurant category. This Application built on top of `Python-Django` and `MongoDB`.
